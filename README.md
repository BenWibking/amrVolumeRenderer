# miniGraphics #

The miniGraphics miniapp demonstrates parallel rendering in an MPI
environment using a sort-last parallel rendering approach. The main
intention of miniGraphics is to demonstrate and compare the image
compositing step where multiple images are combined to a single image
(essentially an optimized reduce operation); however, miniGraphics also has
multiple rendering backends that can be used in conjunction with the
compositing algorithms.
